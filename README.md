# capybara

### Description
I have created a capybara-based testing framework using a page object model approach where I have created tests in order to check whether different GUI components on a web application have been filled in correctly. Retrieving the different elements has been done using the XPATHs and IDs of the individual components within the web application. 

### Languages used
Ruby

### How to download
1. Copy/Clone the URL on GitHub
2. Open selected text editor
3. In selected text editor, open up in-built terminal and type 'git clone' followed by the URL copied from GitHub 

### How to run automation_size.zip
1. Unzip file in separate directory and open in a separate text editor
2. Bundle in the terminal 
3. Rackup in the terminal and leave running in the background so the localhost:9292 stays live

### How to run tests
1. Open up terminal in cloned repository
2. Run rspec in terminal

### Challenges
1. Targeting the slider and the value inside the slider
2. Using XPATH to get elements within a web application

### Learning points
1. Better understanding of using UI testing and how to target specific fields on a web browser
2. Greater knowledge of how to apply capybara as a testing framework
3. Better understanding of using a POM approach
